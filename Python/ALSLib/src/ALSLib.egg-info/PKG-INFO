# ALSLib

## How to install 
The library and it's dependencies can be installed with a global install as follows.

	python -m pip install .\ALSLib

Should you wish to do changes in the library, and want the changes to be reflected while you are working, please use `--editable`

    python -m pip install --editable .\ALSLib
