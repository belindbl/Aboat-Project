Download data.zip and unzip it here.
You should now have the Python/data folder, which allows the usage of yolo detection algorithm,
required by LiveDetectionComparison & LiveSocketCamera

Usage of data/yolo.py :
the weight are loaded once you call one detection function
to perform detection you want to import performDetect as it follows :
from data/yolo.py import performDetect
it can take many arguments, the most important being a numpy array of the image to analyze
the performDetect function returns an array of detections
/!\ it will display the image with bounding boxes if you don't pass |showImage = False| by argument to the function
